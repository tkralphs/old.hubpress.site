<p>Yes, I&#8217;m a little late to the party. I&#8217;ve been thinking about starting a personal blog for probably a decade. At first, blogging seemed a bit too trendy for me. I didn&#8217;t want to contribute more inanity to the already overwhelming amount of chatter being dumped onto the Internet on a daily basis. I wondered if anyone would really care what I had to say or if I would ever have the time to crank out quality blog posts on a regular basis.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I still wonder those things, but I&#8217;ve been feeling more and more as though I have some things I really want to share that can only be disseminated through a blog. I have always been passionate about sharing. The most rewarding part of my job is that I get to share the things I discover with others. At the same time, though, I have been hesitant to self-promote, to push things out on social media. I have  preferred to wait patiently for others to ask about and discover things for themselves. The result has been a lot of potentially useful stuff gathering dust in various physical and mental corners. This blog is about opening up my virtual garage full of dusty things and offering them for the taking. I hope that they will be useful to someone.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This past October, I was invited to address the South African OerationsResearch Society at their annual conference. The theme was <strong>Accessible Analytics</strong> and my <a href="http://coral.ie.lehigh.edu/~ted/files/talks/AccessibleAnalytics.pdf">talk</a> discussed the role openness has played in the short history of operations research. I realized this is a topic I am passionate about! The seed was planted for my virtual garage sale.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I began by opening up shop on <a href="https://github.com/tkralphs">github</a> and starting to post little bits and pieces of code I thought others would find useful. I will be writing about some of these here. I soon discovered <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github pages</a> and then, a few weeks ago, <a href="https://github.com/HubPress/hubpress.io">Hub Press</a>, a static generator for blogs that uses <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> as a publishing platform. I played around with it a bit and was hooked. I will write about my experience with <a href="https://github.com/HubPress/hubpress.io">Hub Press</a> and <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github pages</a> in a future post.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That&#8217;s my story. I hope you enjoy my ramblings. I know I will.</p>
